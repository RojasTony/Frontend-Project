## Features
- The project has multiple features including a Scoreboard to keep track of the Player's and Computer's scores
  as well as for ties. 
- Light up cells for winning combinations.
- Restart Button: This feature was already included in the orignial project but some CSS work was added to it. 

## How it works
- The program is supposed to work like a regular tic-tac-toe game, the player selects a cell,
  and the computer will select one as well until one either wins or draws. The results will later then be shown
  on the scoreboard above. If the player wishes to he/she can click the restart button to reset the game and randomize
  the starting player.
